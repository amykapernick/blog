Quokkas are an adorable animal found on Rottnest Island in Australia. Amy Kapernick is a Twilio Champion who has written a bot that can identify whether a picture sent to it contains a quokka or not. It can even send you a picture of a quokka if you're not sure what one looks like. It's all built using Twilio and some machine learning.
