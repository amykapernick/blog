For the last 5 years, YOW have worked to increase the diversity of tech conferences by running their New Voices in Tech Speaker Training program which offers a full day of speaker training with Damian Conway (travel and accommodation included for interstate participants). For a full day, 10 women in tech from across Australia meet and perfect their speaking skills, learning both from Damian and each other.
