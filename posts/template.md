“You’re all right,” Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, “you’re alive. . . . Oh boys. . And to everybody’s surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together. 

”Ouch! Mum - you’re strangling us -" “I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob. “It’s all I’ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn’t get enough OW.L.s? Oh Fred. . . George. .” “Come on, now, Molly, we’re all perfectly okay,” said Mr. Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house. “Bill,” he added in an undertone, “pick up that paper, I want to see what it says. . .”

## Images

There will be a variety of different kinds of images on a page, sometimes with captions, sometimes without, sometimes as galleries.

The image above has a caption, but the image below does not

Sometimes there will be lots of images as well, in a gallery form, similar to below. These gallery images may or may not have captions

<div class="gallery">

</div>

I'm undecided about whether gallery images must all be the same size (if they are, they should be square), it's up to you whether you want to include a mixture of sizes (square, portrait and landscape) or make them all square.

## Blockquotes

There may be large popout quotes, featured within the content

> “Do us a favor, Perce,” said Bill, yawning, “and shut up.”

## Lists



### List Title

<div class="list">

Here is a list

- Here
- Is
- A
- List

</div>



### Numbered Lists

<div class="list">

Here is a numbered list

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

</div>



### Task Lists

<div class="list full">

- [x]  Done
- [x]  Done
- [ ]  Not Done
- [ ]  Not Done

</div>


## Code

There are `inline code snippets` as well as blocks of code. Don't worry about the syntax highlighting (colours) of the code blocks, I'll do that automatically.

```scss
pre,
code {
	&[class*='language-'] {
		color: #16a6b1;
		font-family: 'Space Mono', 'Anonymous Pro', monospace;
		font-size: 1em;
		text-align: left;

		&.line-numbers {
			padding: 0;
		}

		&::selection,
		&::mozselection {
			background: #6ca7d8;
		}
	}
}
```

```bash
yarn install
```

Code blocks should have the option of adding a label, describing the code language it is (see below for example)

![](/img/feature/homepage.png)

This code block has a label on it, to let readers know that this is a block of `HTML` code.

## Inline Code Snippets

Any inline code snippets (eg. `<code>` ) should look similar to the blocks, but will just be one text and background colour.
