It’s that time of year again, DDD Perth is [open for CFPs](https://sessionize.com/ddd-perth-2022/)! After a slightly smaller event in 2021, we’re back for 2022 and this year we’re aiming for bigger and better than ever before, something we can’t do without an amazing lineup of talent to be our speakers.

If you haven’t come across DDD Perth before, we’re a not for profit conference that runs every year (we don’t talk about 2020) and creates an inclusive, accessible environment for everyone involved (volunteers, speakers, attendees, sponsors, when we say everyone, we mean everyone).

In order to make sure our attendees have a great time, we make sure that our speaker lineup is top-notch, and in order for that to happen, we work with our speakers to give them the support and resources they need to give their best talk yet. In fact, in 2021, 16% of our speakers had never spoken at an event before and a further 25% had only done so once or twice, these speakers gave some of our best rated talks.

Still not convinced? Well here are 10 reasons why you should be a speaker at DDD Perth in 2022

## Training for new (and old) speakers

We don’t care if you’ve never spoken before or if you’ve presented at every conference since the beginning of time. At DDD Perth we know that first time speakers give just as good a presentation as our experienced speakers, and make sure we’re there to help give whatever support they need to get this done.

In the months leading up to the conference, all accepted speakers get the chance to attend our speaker training course, a series of three workshops to help plan, build and give your presentation. This workshop is backed by some of the best international speakers that the Perth tech community has to offer, and you get the chance to draw on their experience and knowledge.

These workshops are run in person and online, so if you’re not in Perth (or can’t make the IRL version), you can still attend remotely. The online sessions are also recorded so you can catch up if you miss both of them, or if you just want a refresher.

Last year we also introduced backup speakers, who might just miss out on making the agenda, but get the chance to attend the training as well and are first in line if a speaker is unable to present on the day. Last year half of the backup speakers ended up on stage and got the chance to give their talk anyway.

## Free Childcare

For those with families, it can be really hard juggling events and kids, especially when the event falls outside of school hours. Luckily DDD Perth not only offers childcare at the conference, but it is free! This year we’re even expanding to include ages 12 and over, and have partnered with She Codes who are running a workshop for anyone 12 and over so your kids can learn as well.

If you’d like, we can also give your kids a chance to see your presentation, in previous years we’ve had speakers who bring their families in to watch their presentation and get to see you in action!

For those really little ones that aren’t quite ready to leave you, you’re welcome to have them with you as well, either in the front row or on stage with you (all stages have ramps for access). In these cases, we also have private rooms available for feeding or just having a quiet time out if you need it (this is available for all attendees as well).

## Social Events

We know how much work it is to put together and give a talk though, so we run a pre-conference event to give speakers a chance to relax and talk to some of the amazing people behind DDD Perth. This is usually held the evening before the conference and is a chance to chat with our volunteers and sponsors as well as our keynote speakers before everyone else does.

## Speaker Mentoring

Whether you’ve done it before or not, we can pair you up with an experienced speaker mentor to help throughout your journey. Whether it’s reviewing a proposal before you submit it, helping plan your talk, building your presentation, or practicing we can have someone to provide advice and feedback to help you give the best performance.

Even on the day, if you just want a friendly face in the audience, we can make sure there are people in the front row. Maybe you need a volunteer during your presentation and want someone who can be called upon, we’ve got volunteers in every room who can help you out. Even if you just want someone to send out a positive tweet about how good your talk was, we have volunteers who are able to generate the online buzz about your speaking prowess.

## Trained Room Coordinators

On the day, each room will have a room coordinator, this person will make sure you’re there and setup with everything before your presentation starts. If you’d like to check things out ahead of time, you can arrange to spend some time getting comfortable in the space with them, they can also give advice on the best places to stand in the room.

These room coordinators will be the ones that introduce you and will check what intro you want and whether you want questions at the end of your presentation. If you’d prefer not to take questions, they’ll wrap up for you, if you’re not sure you can ask them to facilitate questions for you.

## Speaker Gifts

While we know that our speakers do it because they love the experience, we like to make sure that they have something to remember the day by. Sometimes this is a photo of everyone together, other times it’s a handmade message board, others it’s a book or fun craft project we know that you’ll enjoy. If you’ve spoken at a lot of conferences and would prefer not to get a gift, we’ll make a donation on your behalf to a charity/organisation to support their cause.

## Proof of your success

Once the day is over and you’ve wowed your audience and broadened their minds, it’s great to have something to show what you did and to show the next conference how amazing you are. Your talk will be recorded (if you don’t want it to be recorded, just let us know) and made available online after the conference so you can share it with anyone who couldn’t make it, or who wants to know what it’s like to have you present at their event.

There’s also a photographer in each room, so you’ll get plenty of action shots of you giving your presentation. If you’d like to take the chance to get a new headshot or profile picture, just ask your photographer, they’ll be able to help you out.

## Accessibility is the default

We believe that everyone should be able to attend and speak at DDD Perth, no matter their abilities. Every stage has ramp access, and the conference is on one floor, so you don’t have to continually navigate stairs/lifts between sessions. We also have parenting rooms available, a quiet room if you just need some time out, a speaker prep room if you need to make some last minute changes, and various other rooms if you want somewhere to practice or step away from all the noise and chaos of the conference.

We’re working to make further improvements each year, this year with hearing loops in each room. This stretches to our catering experience and making sure that any and all dietary requirements are met, and that everyone has something to eat on the day. If there’s anything that we’ve missed, or that would make your speaking experience easier, please don’t hesitate to ask.

## Bigger (and better)

Every year we work hard to make a bigger and better DDD Perth than the previous year, and this year we’re going all out and expanding to nine (yes, 9) tracks! This means we’ll be looking at around 50 speaking slots being available! While in previous years a speaking slot at DDD Perth has been about as hard to come by as toilet paper is following a press conference from State Daddy, this year we’re expecting the additional slots to mean that 1 in every 4 submissions will be accepted.

## An International Stage

Not only is your talk recorded to show how amazing you are, but that means that people from all over the world are able to see your presentation and learn from it. This means that even if people can’t get an in person ticket, or can’t get to Perth, they’ll be able to watch your talk from anywhere in the world. This also means that we’re not limited to the ~200 people we can fit in each room on the day, but the hundreds and thousands more who can view it online. So no matter where in the world people are, whether they’re in Perth and unable to attend in person, somewhere else in WA, interstate or on the other side of the world, they’ll be able to see you present on stage at DDD Perth.
