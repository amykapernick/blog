Last week I joined [Stacy](https://stacy-clouds.net) on her live stream at NDC London to talk about CSS Grid and implementing it on her personal site.

Throughout the hour on stream we audited the existing CSS layout, making a couple of changes to how Flexbox was being used, then added CSS Grid to be used if the browser supported it.
